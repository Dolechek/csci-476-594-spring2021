## Three lessons learned
* First lesson I have learned is that I need to do a better job organizing files and other items for projects better on my local machines. Between my laptop/desktop I have too many workspaces and things seem cluttered. 
* Second lesson I learned was how to set up the VM & SEED. 
* Third lesson I learned is that I really need to spend more time on the command line and with using Git. I don't feel comfortable nor fast as I would like to be.
